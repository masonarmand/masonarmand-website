      <p>
        Gupta is a game I made in about two weeks for my
        <a href="https://experimentaljams" target="_blank">Experimental Game Jams</a> website.
        Gupta is written in C and uses the
        <a href="https://github.com/raysan5/raylib" target="_blank">Raylib</a> game library.
        The theme for the jam was grid, so I decided to make a roguelike dungeon crawler with chess
        based movement. You can combine different segments of your 'chess piece' to alter your move
        pattern. There is also modifiers you can buy that allow you to do things such as mining or
        exploding surrounding blocks.
