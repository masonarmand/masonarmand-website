      <p>
        Experimental Game Jams is a website about discovering completely new types of gameplay.
        Each month there is a new theme and users must create their game to match that theme.
        The rules are that each game must be made by 1 person and within 1 month, and the game must
        demonstrate a completely new type of gameplay never seen before.
      </p>
      <p>
        Currently the website is written in PHP for the backend using MySQL for the database. I am
        planning on rewriting the site in rust and then open sourcing it.
